## Before You Start
#### Locally

You need to have `PostgreSQL (14)` and `Node.js (20)` installed and working.

Start the postgress service:

For OS:

```
brew services start postgresql
```

For Linux:

```
sudo service postgresql start
```

Install dependencies:

```
npm install
```

Create the postgress user/password:

```
psql -U postgres -c "CREATE USER node_js_exercise_user WITH PASSWORD '123456789';"
```

Change the `.env` file with the following information:

```
POSTGRES_USER=node_js_exercise_user
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=123456789
POSTGRES_HOST=localhost
```

Push the schema into the db:

```
npx prisma db push
```

#### Docker

In case you do not want to install dependencies locally and you have already installed `docker` in your
host machine, you can build the exercise image:

```
make build
```

Set up db:
```
make db-setup
```

Run services:

```
make start
```

And then run a bash container:

```
make terminal
```

If you want to debug mocha with VSCode you must re-start the vscodemocha service every time you run the tests in order to attach the IDE on each run:

```
docker-compose restart vscodemocha
```

## Introduction

Razor has a collection of shows with ticket inventory numbers that need to be
synchronized with a 3rd party API located at https://shows-remote-api.com. A
job runs every hour to check which shows need to be synchronized.

When we synchronize shows, we don't want to synchronize them all at once because
we could overwhelm the 3rd party API with web requests. We prefer to schedule the
show updates at least 15 seconds apart, but if there are more shows than can fit
into a 1 hour period spaced 15 seconds apart, the updates can be scheduled in
shorter intervals.

Your job is to examine the shows in the database and determine which ones need to
be updated, then output a hash with the IDs that need updating and when they should
be updated. You will not update any shows as part of this project, only output the
schedule of when each show should be updated. You only need to schedule updates
for shows that exist in your local database, for which the quantity has changed,
and which have not been updated in the last hour.

## Schema With Examples

```
 shows
-------------------------------
| id | quantity | last_update |
|  1 |       35 |         154 |
|  2 |        4 |       10435 |
|  3 |       89 |        7343 |
|  4 |       15 |       12704 |
|  5 |        2 |        3865 |
-------------------------------
```

  * last_update is represented in seconds since last update.

## Example API Interaction

```
GET https://shows-remote-api.com/
```

Response:
```
[
  { "id": 1, "quantity": 34 },
  { "id": 2, "quantity": 4 },
  { "id": 3, "quantity": 91 },
  { "id": 4, "quantity": 12 },
  { "id": 5, "quantity": 1 }
]
```

## Example Output

In our example, we need to update IDs 3, 4, and 5 because it has been more than
an hour since they were last updated and their quantity has changed.

Hash format is { ID => seconds_until_next_update }

```
{ 3 => 0, 4 => 15, 5 => 30 }
```

#### Implementation Details
  * If an ID has never been updated, it will not have a value for seconds_since_last_update
  * You should test at least 2 things for each example file:
    1. Which IDs should be scheduled for update? The outputs for these are included
       in the spec.
    2. When should each ID be scheduled for update? The answer for this is determined
       by you, but should be in the specified format.

#### Other Information
  * Your solution should use Test-Driven Development
  * Feel free to add any gems you may want to use
  * Any resource you want is available. Ask as many questions as you want.
